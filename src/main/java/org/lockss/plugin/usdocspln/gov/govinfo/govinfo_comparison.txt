FDSys site goes down 12/14/18.  New site (govinfo) can't be harvested until stable prerendered landing pages
are available. The estimate for this is Jan/Feb 2019
But while both sites are up, here's a comparative analysis
Note - also API support is also coming but currently doesn't support publication date, only modification date which wouldn't 
support closed AU sets.
